# How to deploy a Django App?

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Django is a powerful web framework that allows you to deploy your Python applications or websites. It provides a robust set of tools and features, including a high-level ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for database interaction, a built-in administrative interface, and support for authentication and authorization.

In this guide, you’ll configure a Django app and deploy it to Spheron Compute using Docker.

### Prerequisites

To successfully follow this guide, you will need the following:

- A [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your local machine.
- A text editor. You can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your favorite text editor.

## Step 1: Create a Django App

1. Install Django (if you haven't already) by running the following command:
   ```sh
   pip install Django
   ```
2. Create a new Django project by running the following command:
   ```sh
   django-admin startproject django_server
   ```
3. Change into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd django_server
   ```
4. Create a new Django app within the project:
   ```sh
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   ```
5. Open the **django_server/settings.py** file. Add `'myapp'` to the **INSTALLED_APPS** list and `'*'` to the **ALLOWED_HOSTS** list.
6. Open the **myproject/urls.py** file and replace its contents with the following code:

   ```py
   from django.urls import path
   from myapp.views import hello_world

   urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', hello_world),
   ]
   ```

7. Create a new file **myapp/views.py** and add the following code:

   ```py
   from django.http import HttpResponse

   def hello_world(request):
      return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")

   ```

8. Create a new file **requirements.txt**, and add the following:

   ```sh
   Django==3.2.4
   ```

9. Start the development server by running the following command:

   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

10. Open your web browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed.

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

Here's what the dockerfile for this django app will look like:

```sh
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /code

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /code/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the Django project code to the container
COPY . /code/

# Expose the port that Django runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the Django development server
CMD python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Step 3: Set default platform for the docker build

Docker images built with Apple Silicon (or another **ARM64** based architecture) can create issues when deploying the images to a Linux or Windows-based **AMD64** environment.
Before running the docker build command, run this command in your terminal:

```sh
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64
```

## Step 4: Build a Docker image

To build the Docker image:

1. Save the above Dockerfile in the root directory of your Django app.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project, where the Dockerfile is located.
3. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t django_server .
```

4. After the build process completes, you can run a container based on the image using the following command:

```sh
docker run -p 8000:8000 django_server
```

## Step 5: Push the app to DockerHub

To push an image, you first need to create a repository on Docker Hub.

### Create a repo

To create a repository on Docker Hub:

1. [Sign up](https://www.docker.com/pricing?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs_driven_upgrade) or Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
2. Select the Create Repository button.
3. For the repo name, use django_server. Make sure the Visibility is Public.
4. Select the Create button.

### Push the image

1. Login to the Docker Hub using the command docker login -u YOUR-USER-NAME.
2. Use the docker tag command to give the django_server image a new name. Be sure to swap out YOUR-USER-NAME with your Docker ID.

```sh
docker tag django_server YOUR-USER-NAME/django_server
```

3. Now try your push command again. If you’re copying the value from Docker Hub, you can drop the tagname portion, as you didn’t add a tag to the image name. If you don’t specify a tag, Docker will use a tag called latest.

```sh
docker push YOUR-USER-NAME/django_server
```

**Here's what a Docker Image will look like on Docker Hub:**

> Check out this docker image [here.](https://hub.docker.com/r/rekpero/nft-minter-server/tags)

## Step 6: Run on Spheron Compute

To run your app on Spheron:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
3. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
4. Select **Import from Docker Hub**.
5. Enter the names for your cluster and docker image.
6. Then, Add the tag and Click "Next."
7. When selecting a region, we recommend starting by trying to deploy in a region closer to you. If you encounter any issues, you can consider switching to other regions. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
8. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, Create new Port Policy Mapping and just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
9. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
10. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
11. Create new Port Policy Mapping. Add the container port, and Select the exposed port you want to map it to. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#port-mapping) to know more.
12. Add **Environment Variable**, if any.
13. Add **Secret Environment Variable** if the value is a secret key. It will not be saved in the database. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#environment-variables) to know more.
14. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration) to know more.
15. You can add health checkup if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#health-checkup) to know more.
16. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

  **NOTE:** Spheron supports only public docker images at the moment.
</Callout>

## Verify Installation

The Django App can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using the app.
Your Apps can be verified for successful installation using the instructions below, while others may require different procedures.

Follow these instructions to verify the installation:

- **Attempt to access the app** \
  An App has an estimated deployment time of about 1-2 minutes.
  If you can successfully access it, the installation has been completed successfully.
  You can connect using the connection URL of the instance, which will also be provided after the instance is provisioned.
- **Check instance logs and events** \
  After successfully deploying your Django App, it will produce logs and events, which you can check for any issues or errors.

## Common Errors

### Docker Fails When Building on Apple Silicon

<Callout type="error">
  ERROR: exec /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: exec format error
</Callout>

Docker images built with Apple Silicon (or another **ARM64** based architecture) can create issues when deploying the images to a Linux or Windows-based **AMD64** environment.
Before running the docker build command, you must run this command in your terminal:

```sh
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64
```
