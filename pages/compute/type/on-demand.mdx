# On Demand Compute

Spheron offers On Demand compute to adjust the computational resources allocated to an instance. Users can make decisions
to increase or decrease the allocated resources, such as CPU, memory, or storage, to meet changing performance requirements.
This type provides users with direct control over resource adjustments, allowing for optimization based
on specific workload characteristics and immediate operational needs.

<Callout type="warning">
  The On Demand compute is currently in its closed alpha stage. Potential
  irregularities may lead to brief service downtimes. We recommend utilizing
  this feature exclusively in testing or development environments until its
  official release for optimal stability. If you're interested in obtaining
  alpha access, please use this
  [link](https://meetings.hubspot.com/prashant-maurya/scaling-demo) to schedule
  a call with our team.

## How to use On Demand Compute?

### With Docker

To use On Demand compute with a custom Docker image on Spheron:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Import from Docker Hub**.
3. Enter the names for your cluster and docker image.
4. Then, Add the tag and Click "Next".
5. Select "On Demand" under **Compute Type**.
6. When selecting a region, we recommend starting by trying to deploy in a region closer to you. If you encounter any issues, you can consider switching to other regions. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
7. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
8. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
9. Create new **Port Policy Mapping**. Add the container port, and Select the exposed port you want to map it to. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#port-mapping) to know more.
10. Add **Environment Variable**, if any.
11. Add **Secret Environment Variable** if the value is a secret key. It will not be saved in the database. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#environment-variables) to know more.
12. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#advanced-configuration) to know more.
13. You can add health checkup if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#health-checkup) to know more.
14. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

### With Marketplace App

To use On Demand compute with a marketplace app on Spheron:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Start from marketplace app**.
3. Pick your desired template from the marketplace.
4. Select "On Demand" under **Compute Type**.
5. When selecting a region, we recommend starting by trying to deploy in a region closer to you. If you encounter any issues, you can consider switching to other regions. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
7. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
8. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#additional-configuration-1) to know more.
9. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## How to update configuration of your instance?

To update the configuration of your instance:

1. Select your instance and Go to the **Settings** tab, below the cluster information card.
2. Click "Update Instance" under the **Instance Plan** section.
3. Update the instance plan to suit your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
4. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
5. You can update advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#additional-configuration-1) to know more.
6. Click "Update" to initiate deployment.

## Limitations

- **Human Intervention:** On Demand compute requires human intervention, which can lead to delays in responding to changing workloads.
- **Scalability:** On Demand compute might not be efficient for systems that need to handle varying workloads. It can be challenging to predict the exact resource requirements for different levels of demand, which can result in under-provisioning or over-provisioning of resources.
- **Downtime and Disruption:** On Demand compute resources manually can lead to downtime or disruption in service. Adjusting resources may require stopping or restarting parts of the system, leading to potential service interruptions for users.
- **Complexity:** As the system grows, the complexity of manually managing resources increases. In large and distributed environments, keeping track of resource allocation and utilization becomes more challenging, resulting in poor performance and user dissatisfaction.
