# Spheron Terraform

Guide on how to use the Spheron Terraform provider. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Terraform (version 0.13 or later)
- Spheron provider plugin (version 1.0.0 or later)

## Installation

Spheron Terraform provider can be accessed here:
[Spheron Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spheronFdn/spheron/latest)

To install the Spheron provider plugin, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the directory to your Terraform project directory.
3. Create a new file named terraform.tf in the project directory (if it doesn't exist already).
4. Open the terraform.tf file using a text editor.
5. Add the following lines to the file:

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    spheron = {
      source = "spheronFdn/spheron"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```
6. Save the file.

## Configuration

To configure the Spheron provider, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terraform configuration file for your project (e.g., main.tf) using a text editor.
2. Add the following block to the configuration file:
```
provider "spheron" {
  token = "" // or use SPHERON_TOKEN env variable
}
```

## Usage

To use the Spheron provider in your Terraform code, follow these steps:

1. Write your desired infrastructure code using Terraform, incorporating the Spheron provider resources and data sources.
2. Save the Terraform configuration file (e.g., main.tf).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Change the directory to your Terraform project directory.
5. Run the following command to initialize the Terraform project and download the Spheron provider plugin:
```
terraform init
```
6. After initialization completes successfully, you can proceed with other Terraform commands such as plan, apply, etc., depending on your workflow.

## Spheron Terraform Provider

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    spheron = {
      source = "spheronFdn/spheron"
