<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Avail, all set up and ready to use.
To deploy a Avail full node follow below steps:

1. Follow [the steps](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-an-avail-node-in-minutes-using-spheron-compute#heading-step-1-create-a-free-spheron-network-account) to create a Free Spheron Network Account  
2. Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the Create Organization page, where you can give your organization name and choose Avatar. Ensure the **"Compute"** option is selected from the drop-down menu of the **"Start With"** option. Click 'Continue'. 
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the **"Create New Projects"** button. Add 'Project Title' And 'Project Description' and Click 'Create'.
4. Choose **"Compute"** to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
5. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
6. Click **"Start from Marketplace App"** and Select **"Avail Full Node"** from the marketplace.
7. Select your preferred region for deployment. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. **US-West** has a higher chance of deploying everything successfully. You can start from the US-West option. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
8. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click 'Deploy' to initiate deployment.
9. If you want you can Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the **"Create Custom Plan"** toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
10. You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.
11. Spheron has made it easy and auto-filled the configuration options. But if you want, you can Update the name and the chain details under arguments in advanced configuration.
    You can add more advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
12. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

<Callout type="info">
**NOTE:** Wait for your node to be fully set up. After it's provisioned, you'll see an option called ‘Overview’ in the dashboard; click on it to see all the details of the deployed node on the 'Avail Full Node'.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Avail Full Node with Spheron:

[![Deploy with Spheron](https://bafybeihxqi3jlv6cy2ogh6jjljinntisolbspxcrbgykyv6e5xyzujl3aa.ipfs.sphn.link/spheron-deploy.svg)](https://app.spheron.network/#/compute/marketplace?template=Avail%20Full%20Node&templateId=656e06082916d0f8ea6b75b7)

## Verify Installation

- The Avail Full Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
  Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
- Go to [Avail Telemetry](https://telemetry.avail.tools), and check the synchronization status of the node. The block needs to attain a specific hash to become part of the validation network.
_**The synchronization will take time as per the network ~15hrs**_
- As the node starts, the **Instance Logs** will display the output about the operations performed. If you see messages that blocks are being proposed and finalized, you have a running node.
