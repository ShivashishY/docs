  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Pryzm, all set up and ready to use.
To deploy a Pryzm validator testnet:

1. Follow [the steps](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-a-pryzm-node-in-minutes-using-spheron-compute#heading-step-1-create-a-free-spheron-network-account) to create a Free Spheron Network Account.  
2. Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the Create Organization page, where you can give your organization name and choose Avatar. Ensure the **"Compute"** option is selected from the drop-down menu of the **"Start With"** option. Click 'Continue'. 
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the **"Create New Projects"** button. Add 'Project Title' And 'Project Description' and Click 'Create'.
4. Choose **"Compute"** to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
5. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
6. Click **"Start from Marketplace App"** and Select **"Pryzm Validator Testnet"** from the marketplace.
7. When selecting a region, we recommend starting by trying to deploy in a region closer to you. If you encounter any issues, you can consider switching to other regions. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
8. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click 'Deploy' to initiate deployment.
9. If you want you can Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the **"Create Custom Plan"** toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
10. You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.
11. Next, Add your "Moniker" under **Template Configuration**. You can add more advanced configurations if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
12. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Verify Installation

- The Pryzm Validator Testnet can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
  Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
- As the node starts, the **Instance Logs** will display the output about the operations performed. You can refresh the logs by clicking the refresh icon.

### Prepare Your Environment

1. Before issuing any commands, initialize your environment by running:

```sh
. $HOME/.profile
```

2. If you encounter an error that says **`/bin/sh: 1: pryzmd: not found`**, run the same command again to fix it.

### Create or Recover Your Wallet

1. **To create a new wallet**

```sh
pryzmd keys add wallet
```

2. **To recover an existing wallet**

```sh
pryzmd keys add wallet --recover
```

Then, enter your mnemonic phrase when prompted.

### Fund Your Wallet

1. Visit the [faucet app](https://testnet.pryzm.zone/faucet) to request test tokens for your wallet.
2. Check your wallet balance using:

```sh
pryzmd q bank balances $(pryzmd keys show wallet -a)
```

Make sure you receive at least **2 upryzm** tokens.

3. If you don't see a balance, your node might still be syncing with the blockchain. Wait until the **`catching_up`** status is **`false`**.
4. Monitor your wallet on the Pryzm Explorer: Keep an eye on your transactions and balance by visiting [Pryzm Explorer](https://testnet.chainsco.pe/pryzm) and entering your wallet address. This step is crucial for ensuring that your wallet has been successfully funded and is correctly reflecting the transactions on the blockchain.

### Verify Network Synchronization

Check the synchronization status with:

```sh
pryzmd status | jq .SyncInfo
```

Proceed when **`catching_up`** turns to **`false`**.

### Register Your Validator

1. Use the following command to create your validator, replacing placeholders with your information:

```sh
pryzmd tx staking create-validator --amount 1000000upryzm --pubkey $(pryzmd tendermint show-validator) --moniker "your-moniker-name" --details "your-details" --website "your-website" --security-contact "your-email" --chain-id indigo-1 --commission-rate 0.05 --commission-max-rate 0.20 --commission-max-change-rate 0.01 --min-self-delegation 1 --from wallet --gas-adjustment 1.4 --gas auto --gas-prices 0.015upryzm -y
```

2. Customize the command with your details: <br /> Replace **`your-moniker-name`**, **`your-details`**, **`your-website`**, and **`your-email`** with your own information.
3. Wait a few minutes after executing this command, before checking your node on the [Pryzm validators list](https://testnet.chainsco.pe/pryzm/validators).

## Deploy Your Own
