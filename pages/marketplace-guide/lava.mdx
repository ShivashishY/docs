<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Lava, all set up and ready to use.
To deploy a Lava validator testnet:

1. Follow [the steps](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-a-lava-node-in-minutes-using-spheron-compute#heading-step-1-create-a-free-spheron-network-account) to create a Free Spheron Network Account.  
2. Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the Create Organization page, where you can give your organization name and choose Avatar. Ensure the **"Compute"** option is selected from the drop-down menu of the **"Start With"** option. Click 'Continue'. 
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the **"Create New Projects"** button. Add 'Project Title' And 'Project Description' and Click 'Create'.
4. Choose **"Compute"** to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
5. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
6. Click **"Start from Marketplace App"** and Select **"Lava validator Testnet"** from the marketplace.
7. Select your preferred region for deployment. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. **US-West** has a higher chance of deploying everything successfully. You can start from the US-West option. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
8. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click 'Deploy' to initiate deployment.
9. If you want you can Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the **"Create Custom Plan"** toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
10. You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.
11. Next, Add your "Moniker" under **Template Configuration**. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Think of the Moniker as a nickname for your node that will help you identify it on the blockchain network.
</Callout>
12. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.


## Verify Installation

- The Lava Validator Testnet can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
  Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
- As the node starts, the **Instance Logs** will display the output about the operations performed. You can refresh the logs by clicking the refresh icon.

### Create or Recover Your Wallet

Go to **Shell Command** from the left navigation and follow these steps:

1. **To create a new wallet**

```sh
lavad keys add wallet
```

2. **To recover an existing wallet**

```sh
lavad keys add wallet --recover
```

Then, enter your mnemonic phrase when prompted.

### Fund Your Wallet

1. Visit the **#faucet** channel on the [official Lava Network Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Tbk5NxTCdA) and request funds by sharing the address you previously created.
2. Check your wallet balance using:

```sh
lavad q bank balances $(lavad keys show wallet -a)
```

Make sure you have at least **100000ulava** tokens.

3. If you don't see a balance, your node might still be syncing with the blockchain. Wait until the **`catching_up`** status is **`false`**.
4. Monitor your wallet on the Lava Explorer: Keep an eye on your transactions and balance by visiting [Lava Explorer](https://lava.explorers.guru/validators) and entering your wallet address. This step is crucial for ensuring that your wallet has been successfully funded and is correctly reflecting the transactions on the blockchain.

### Verify Network Synchronization

Check the synchronization status with:

```sh
lavad status | jq .SyncInfo
```

Proceed when **`catching_up`** turns to **`false`**.

### Register Your Validator

1. Use the following command to create your validator, replacing placeholders with your information:

```sh
lavad tx staking create-validator --amount=90000ulava --pubkey=$(lavad tendermint show-validator) --moniker "YOUR_MONIKER_NAME" --details "YOUR_DETAILS" --website "YOUR_WEBSITE_URL" --chain-id=lava-testnet-2 --commission-rate=0.1 --commission-max-rate=0.2 --commission-max-change-rate=0.05 --min-self-delegation=1 --gas="auto" --gas-adjustment "1.5" --gas-prices="0.05ulava" --from=wallet -y
```

2. Customize the command with your details: <br /> Replace **`YOUR_MONIKER_NAME`**, **`YOUR_DETAILS`**, and **`YOUR_WEBSITE_URL`** with your information.
3. Make sure you see the validator details:

```sh
lavad q staking validator $(lavad keys show wallet --bech val -a)
```

4. Wait a few minutes after executing this command, before checking your node on the [Lava validators list](https://lava.explorers.guru/validators).
