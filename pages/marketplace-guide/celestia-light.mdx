  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Celestia, all set up and ready to use.
To deploy a Celestia light node:

1. Follow [the steps](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-a-celestia-light-node-on-spheron-in-minutes#heading-step-by-step-guide) to create a Free Spheron Network Account  
2. Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the Create Organization page, where you can give your organization name and choose Avatar. Ensure the **"Compute"** option is selected from the drop-down menu of the **"Start With"** option. Click 'Continue'. 
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the **"Create New Projects"** button. Add 'Project Title' And 'Project Description' and Click 'Create'.
4. Choose **"Compute"** to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
5. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
6. Click **"Start from Marketplace App"** and Select **"Celestia Light Node"** from the marketplace.
7. When selecting a region, we recommend starting by trying to deploy in a region closer to you. If you encounter any issues, you can consider switching to other regions. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. **US-West** has a higher chance of deploying everything successfully. You can start from the US-West option. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
8. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just click 'Deploy' to initiate deployment.
9. If you want you can Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the **"Create Custom Plan"** toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
10. You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.
11. Next, you will see the configuration section. Spheron automatically configure networking, ports, parameters, and commands for you. Spheron abstracts away the difficulty of configuring a node.
    You can add more advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
12. Click **"Deploy"** to initiate deployment.


## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Celestia Light Client with Spheron:

[![Deploy with Spheron](https://bafybeihxqi3jlv6cy2ogh6jjljinntisolbspxcrbgykyv6e5xyzujl3aa.ipfs.sphn.link/spheron-deploy.svg)](https://app.spheron.network/#/compute/marketplace?template=Celestia%20Light%20Node&templateId=65a7c87367881e47ff6df9ad)

## Verify Installation

- The Celestia Light Client can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
  Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
- As the node starts, the **Instance Logs** will display the output about the operations performed. If you see this in your logs, you have a running node.

Check out the [Celestia Docs](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/light-node#testnet-tokens) for more info on getting Testnet tokens from the Arabica and Mocha testnets.

You will need to fund that address with testnet tokens to pay for “PayForBlob” transactions.
