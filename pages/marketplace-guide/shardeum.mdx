</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Shardeum Testnet Validator, all set up and ready to use.
To deploy a Shardeum Testnet Validator node:

1. Follow [the steps](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-and-stake-a-shardeum-validator-on-spheron-in-minutes#heading-step-1-create-a-free-spheron-network-account) to create a Free Spheron Network Account.  
2. Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the Create Organization page, where you can give your organization name and choose Avatar. Ensure the **"Compute"** option is selected from the drop-down menu of the **"Start With"** option. Click 'Continue'. 
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the **"Create New Projects"** button. Add 'Project Title' And 'Project Description' and Click 'Create'.
4. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
5. Choose **On-Demand** or **Autoscale** Compute Type option under **Compute Type**. It is recommended to opt for **On-Demand** when configuring the Shardeum Node.
6. Click **"Start from Marketplace App"** and Select **"Shardeum Testnet Validator"** from the marketplace.
7. Select your preferred region for deployment. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. **US-West** has a higher chance of deploying everything successfully. You can start from the US-West option. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
8. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click 'Deploy' to initiate deployment.
9. If you want you can Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the **"Create Custom Plan"** toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
10. You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.
11. Next, add "Password" under **Template Configuration**. Spheron automatically configure networking, ports, parameters, and commands for you. You can add more advanced configurations if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
12. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## How to access Shardeum UI?

Once the deployment is complete and you have a provider host with assigned ports, follow these steps:

1. In your terminal:

```
ping provider.us-east.spheron.wiki
# or
ping provider.spheron.wiki
```

2. Go to the 'Overview' section and click on the deployed shardeum node.
3. Copy the connection URL and go to the Settings option.
3. In the setting option, scroll down the configuration and copy and paste the connection URL address, leaving HTTP:// and :9001 and paste it to the 'SERVERIP' and 'LOCALLANP'.
4. Click "Update" to update instance configuration.
5. Follow the [step-by-step guide](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-and-stake-a-shardeum-validator-on-spheron-in-minutes#heading-step-5-staking-your-shardeum-validator-to-join-the-testnet) to staking your Shardeum Validator to join the testnet.

**NOTE:** This will work only when the instance log
displays the message:

```
Starting operator gui
done
```

## How to run the node?

1. Go to you deployed node in Spheron and go under Port Policy.
2. Open the Connection URL under port 8080 for e.g. "`https://provider.us-west.spheron.wik:22085/`". 
3. It will open the Shardeum UI, enter your password and Click "Connect".
4. Navigate to the **Maintenance** tab.
5. Under Add/Remove Stake, Click "Connect Wallet" and stake **SHM tokens**.
6. Under Start/Stop Node, Click "Start Node" Your node will initially be in “Standby” mode but become “Active” during the next rotation.
