  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Subspace, all set up and ready to use.
To deploy a Subspace node:

1. Follow [the steps](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-a-subspace-node-in-minutes-using-spheron-compute#heading-step-1-create-a-free-spheron-network-account) to create a Free Spheron Network Account.  
2. Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the Create Organization page, where you can give your organization name and choose Avatar. Ensure the **"Compute"** option is selected from the drop-down menu of the **"Start With"** option. Click 'Continue'. 
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the **"Create New Projects"** button. Add 'Project Title' And 'Project Description' and Click 'Create'.
4. Choose **"Compute"** to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
5. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
6. Click **"Start from Marketplace App"** and Select **"Subspace Network"** from the marketplace.
7. When selecting a region, we recommend starting by trying to deploy in a region closer to you. If you encounter any issues, you can consider switching to other regions. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
8. Select the "farmer" tab under **Personalize Your Compute Service** section.
9. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click 'Deploy' to initiate deployment.
10. If you want you can Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the **"Create Custom Plan"** toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
11. You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.
12. Next, Add your "wallet address" under Template Configuration. You can add more advanced configurations if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
13. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Create a Sub Wallet

### Install Sub Wallet Chrome Extension

1. Go to the Chrome Web Store and search for "Sub Wallet - Polkadot Wallet Link". Or Download it from [Here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/subwallet-polkadot-wallet/onhogfjeacnfoofkfgppdlbmlmnplgbn).
2. Click "Add to Chrome" and follow the prompts to install the extension.

### Create a Sub Wallet Account

1. Click on the Sub Wallet extension icon in your Chrome browser.
2. On the SubWallet page, Click "Create a new account".
3. Agree to the terms and conditions by clicking the checkbox and then Click "Continue".
4. Create a secure password for your account. Remember to save it securely as SubWallet cannot recover lost passwords. Copy or download the seed phrase provided.
5. Confirm that you have securely stored the seed phrase by clicking "I have kept it somewhere safe."

### Configure Subspace Gemini 3H Network

1. Click on the settings icon located in the upper right corner.
2. Navigate to the **Network** section and enable "Subspace Gemini 3H".

### Copy Wallet Address

1. Return to the main menu of the SubWallet extension.
2. Click "tSSC" and copy the wallet address.

## Verify Installation

- The Subspace Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
  Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
- The **Instance Logs** of the "Farmer Service" will display the output about the operations performed.
- You can also access the Subspace Plot Manager using the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info for Port 8080** to verify if the plots are being created.
