# How to deploy an Babylon Validator Testnet?

<VideoPlayer embedId="Qm-9WcXXwPs" />

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Babylon, all set up and ready to use.
To deploy a Babylon validator testnet:

1. Follow [the steps](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-a-babylon-node-in-minutes-using-spheron-compute#heading-step-1-create-a-free-spheron-network-account) to create a Free Spheron Network Account  
2. Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the Create Organization page, where you can give your organization name and choose Avatar. Ensure the **"Compute"** option is selected from the drop-down menu of the **"Start With"** option. Click 'Continue'. 
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the **"Create New Projects"** button. Add 'Project Title' And 'Project Description' and Click 'Create'.
4. Choose **"Compute"** to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
5. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
6. Click **"Start from Marketplace App"** and Select **"Babylong Validator Testnet"** from the marketplace.
7. When selecting a region, we recommend starting by trying to deploy in a region closer to you. If you encounter any issues, you can consider switching to other regions. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
8. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just click 'Deploy' to initiate deployment.
9. If you want you can Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the **"Create Custom Plan"** toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
10. You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.
11. Next, you will see the configuration section. Go to the 'Advanced Configuration' section. **you'll be asked to provide a unique identifier for your node, known as a "Moniker." Think of the Moniker as a nickname for your node that will help you identify it on the blockchain network.**
    You can add more advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
12. Click **"Deploy"** to initiate deployment. With Moniker, once your node is published as a validator, you can check it in the [Babylon dashboard](https://babylonscan.io/validators).


## Verify Installation

- The Babylon Validator Testnet can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
  Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
- As the node starts, the **Instance Logs** will display the output about the operations performed. You can refresh the logs by clicking the refresh icon.

### Create or Recover Your Wallet

You can run the following command in **Shell**:

```sh
babylond keys add wallet
```

To recover an existing wallet, use the below command:

<Callout type="info">
Note: You can reuse the same wallet in a new node by running this command.
</Callout>

```sh
babylond keys add wallet --recover
```

### Fund Your Wallet

1. Visit the `#faucet` channel on the official Babylon Discord server.
2. Request funds by sharing the address you created in the channel using the command:

```sh
!faucet <your-address>
```

3. Check your wallet balance using this command:

```sh
babylond q bank balances $(babylond keys show wallet -a)
```

Ensure you have received **1,100,000 ubbn**.

### Generate a BLS Key Pair

Wait for the funds to be credited, then run this command:

```sh
babylond create-bls-key $(babylond keys show wallet -a)
```

### Update Configurations

Run the following commands to update configuration:

```sh
> sed -i -e "s|^key-name *=.*|key-name = \"wallet\"|" $HOME/.babylond/config/app.toml
> sed -i -e "s|^timeout_commit *=.*|timeout_commit = \"10s\"|" $HOME/.babylond/config/config.toml
```

### Verify Network Synchronization

Check the synchronization status with:

```sh
babylond status | jq .SyncInfo
```

Proceed when **`catching_up`** turns to **`false`**.

### Register Your Validator

1. Use the following command to create your validator, replacing placeholders with your information:

```sh
babylond tx checkpointing create-validator --amount 1000000ubbn --pubkey $(babylond tendermint show-validator) --moniker "YOUR_MONIKER_NAME" --details "YOUR_DETAILS" --website "YOUR_WEBSITE_URL" --chain-id bbn-test-2 --commission-rate 0.05 --commission-max-rate 0.20 --commission-max-change-rate 0.01 --min-self-delegation 1 --from wallet --gas-adjustment 1.4 --gas auto --gas-prices 0.00001ubbn -y
```

2. Customize the command with your details: <br /> Replace **`your-moniker-name`**, **`your-details`**, **`your-website`**, and **`your-email`** with your own information.
3. Wait for 2-3 hours before checking your node in the inactive list at [Babylon validators list](https://babylon.explorers.guru/validators)
