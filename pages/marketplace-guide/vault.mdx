  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with HashiCorp Vault, all set up and ready to use.
To deploy a Vault:

1. Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the Create Organization page, where you can give your organization name and choose Avatar. Ensure the **"Compute"** option is selected from the drop-down menu of the **"Start With"** option. Click 'Continue'. 
2. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the **"Create New Projects"** button. Add 'Project Title' And 'Project Description' and Click 'Create'.
3. Choose **"Compute"** to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
4. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
5. Click **"Start from Marketplace App"** and Select **"HashiCorp Vault"** from the marketplace.
6. Select your preferred region for deployment. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. **US-West** has a higher chance of deploying everything successfully. You can start from the US-West option. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
7. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click 'Deploy' to initiate deployment.
8. If you want you can Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the **"Create Custom Plan"** toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
9. You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.
10. Next, Add "Token Id" and "Listen Address" under Template Configuration. Spheron has made it easy and auto-filled the configuration options. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
11. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advance Configuration

- **Token Id** - The Token ID used for authentication with HashiCorp Vault. This token provides access to perform operations and retrieve secrets from the Vault.
- **Listen Address** - The network address and port where HashiCorp Vault will listen for incoming connections. This address determines how clients can reach the Vault server.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own HashiCorp Vault with Spheron:

## Verify Installation

HashiCorp Vault can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to HashiCorp Vault?

- Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info** to access the Vault dashboard.
- For login, use the `Root Token` from the instance logs.
