  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Elixir, all set up and ready to use.
To deploy a Elixir validator node:

1. Follow [the steps](https://blog.spheron.network/step-by-step-guide-to-launching-an-elixir-node-with-spheron#heading-step-1-create-a-free-spheron-network-account) to create a Free Spheron Network Account  
2. Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the Create Organization page, where you can give your organization name and choose Avatar. Ensure the **"Compute"** option is selected from the drop-down menu of the **"Start With"** option. Click 'Continue'. 
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the **"Create New Projects"** button. Add 'Project Title' And 'Project Description' and Click 'Create'.
4. Choose **"Compute"** to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
5. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
6. Click **"Start from Marketplace App"** and Select **"Elixir Validator"** from the marketplace.
7. Select your preferred region for deployment. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency. **US-West** has a higher chance of deploying everything successfully. You can start from the US-West option. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
8. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click 'Deploy' to initiate deployment.
9. If you want you can Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the **"Create Custom Plan"** toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
10. You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.
11. Next, Add your "wallet address" and "private key" under **Template Configuration**. You can add more advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
12. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

Wait for your node to be fully set up. After it's provisioned, you'll see an option called ‘Overview’ in the dashboard; click on it to see all the details of the deployed node on Subspace.

## Template Configuration

- **Address** - This is the wallet address.
- **Private Key** - Private key you get from your wallet address
- **Validator Name** -  You Can Give Any Name E.g - AnonValidator (Don't add spaces in name to avoid any issue)

## Enroll your wallet as a Validator

- Navigate to the [Elixir Network Dashboard](https://dashboard.elixir.finance/) with your wallet-connected browser.
- Connect with Metamask and switch to the Goerli network.
- Click "claim ELXR" next to the **Actions** section.
- After receiving ELXR tokens, proceed to stake any amount between **100-1000 ELXR**.
- Click "enroll" under Actions, and then enter the **wallet address** added while deploying up your validator.
- Once the transaction is confirmed, ensure that valid orders are being processed by checking the **Instance Logs** section on the Spheron Instance page.
